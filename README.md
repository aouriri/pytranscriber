[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/aouriri/pytranscriber/main)

## to do (later)
- [X] create logo
  - may rework it...
- [X] figure out how to merge spacy_streamlit NER with [OpenTapioca](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/spacyopentapioca#vizualization) 
  - *mostly* figured out, QIDs not linked to Wikidata entry; ```displacy_options``` [(example)](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-streamlit/blob/dffa3fb6b1faa5ddf8098fea24132ad79f7f79e1/examples/04_visualize-ner-extra-options.py) enhancement may work once it's fully incorporated
- [ ] add file upload option for speech-to-text
- [ ] [train Watson model](https://www.ibm.com/demos/live/content/watson/stt/lab/hands-on-lab-customization.pdf) using corpus?
- [ ] try out STT "smart formatting" (currently in beta)
